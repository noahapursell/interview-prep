# 📚 Common Coding Interview Patterns

Most coding interview questions fall under a handful of key patterns. Mastering these will prepare you for the majority of problems.

---

## 🔁 1. Sliding Window
Used for problems involving contiguous sequences in arrays or strings.

- **Examples**: Maximum Sum Subarray, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- **Data Structures**: Array, String
- **Time Complexity Target**: O(n)

---

## 📊 2. Two Pointers
Used when processing elements from both ends of a sequence.

- **Examples**: Reverse a String, Container With Most Water, 3Sum
- **Data Structures**: Array, String

---

## 🥇 3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise & Hare)
Great for cycle detection and identifying duplicates.

- **Examples**: Linked List Cycle, Happy Number, Find Duplicate Number
- **Data Structures**: Array, Linked List

---

## 📚 4. Merge Intervals
Used to merge or manipulate overlapping intervals.

- **Examples**: Merge Intervals, Insert Interval, Meeting Rooms
- **Data Structures**: List of Pairs (Intervals)

---

## 🧮 5. Hashing & Frequency Counting
Use hash tables to count or track frequency.

- **Examples**: Two Sum, Group Anagrams, Top K Frequent Elements
- **Data Structures**: Hash Map, Hash Set

---

## 🔀 6. Prefix Sum / Difference Array
Helps with fast range queries and subarray problems.

- **Examples**: Subarray Sum Equals K, Range Sum Query, Subarrays with Sum Divisible by K

---

## 🌲 7. Binary Search
Search in sorted arrays or even on the answer space.

- **Examples**: Binary Search, Search in Rotated Array, Koko Eating Bananas

---

## 🔁 8. DFS/BFS (Graph Traversal)
Explore nodes in trees, graphs, or matrices.

- **Examples**: Number of Islands, Clone Graph, Word Ladder
- **Structures**: Graph, Tree, Matrix

---

## 🌳 9. Tree Traversal
Recursive and iterative tree operations.

- **Examples**: Validate BST, Lowest Common Ancestor, Diameter of Binary Tree

---

## 🧵 10. Recursion & Backtracking
Explore all combinations or permutations.

- **Examples**: N-Queens, Word Search, Subsets, Sudoku Solver

---

## 🧠 11. Dynamic Programming (DP)
For problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

- **Examples**: Climbing Stairs, LCS, Knapsack, Coin Change

---

## 🧮 12. Greedy Algorithms
Make the locally optimal choice at each step.

- **Examples**: Jump Game, Gas Station, Task Scheduling

---

## ⛓️ 13. Stack / Monotonic Stack
Used to track previous/next greater or smaller elements.

- **Examples**: Valid Parentheses, Daily Temperatures, Largest Rectangle in Histogram

---

## 🌊 14. Union-Find / Disjoint Set
Efficiently manage connected components.

- **Examples**: Number of Connected Components, Accounts Merge, Kruskal’s Algorithm
